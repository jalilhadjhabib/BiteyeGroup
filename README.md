## Project Description
The primary objective of this project was to create a web-based sales management platform catering to the specific needs of Biteye Group's sales agents. The platform aimed to streamline the lead management process, improve lead conflict resolution, enhance process traceability, and facilitate appointment scheduling. It also included features such as role and permission management for different platform users.

The system's frontend utilized modern JavaScript frameworks, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface, while the backend employed PHP and Laravel to manage the business logic and data interactions.

The sales management system developed during this project exemplifies my capabilities in web development and showcases the potential impact of technology on businesses in the real estate sector.
